My name is Andrey Varfolomeev. I am Software Engineer and a Linux fan. I'm interested in computer science, algorithms and data structures, compiler design, server-side programming and text editors (Neovim and Helix in particular).

In my spare time, I like to eat Asian food, walk around the university campus, play competitive computer games.
